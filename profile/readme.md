<!-- OUR MISSION SECTION -->

## Our Mission

<div align="left">
  <p>
    At LumisPay, our mission is to reinvent the way monetary transactions work by establishing new standards of transparency, fairness, and security. We believe payments should not only be simple but should also put you in complete control. By leveraging self-custodial solutions, LumisPay ensures that merchants and consumers have direct ownership and oversight of their funds, removing reliance on third-party custodians.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our goal is to provide a fast, secure, and cost-effective payment experience that adapts to the diverse needs of our partners, fostering trust through true financial empowerment and decentralization.
